# Vipps Recurring API: How It Works

Vipps Recurring can be used for subscriptions, donations or other recurring payments.

[Vipps Recurring API](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-recurring-api).

## The recurring payment process

## 1. Buy a subscription with Vipps

A user chooses Vipps as payment method for a subscription on a merchant’s website or app.

## 2. The Vipps landing page

If the payment was started on a desktop device, the user will be sent to the Vipps landing page.
The user confirms their number and is prompted to log in to Vipps.

If the payment was started from a mobile device, the app will automatically switch over to Vipps.

## 3. Accept agreement in Vipps

The user receives a push notification on their phone. They log in to Vipps and accept the agreement.

If there is an initial charge to be made, the user confirms the payment in this step as well

## 4. Confirmation of subscription

The user is redirected back to the merchant’s web site or app, and the subscription is confirmed on the merchant’s page.

## 5. Overview of agreements and charges

The user can see their active subscriptions, as well as stopped subscriptions, and get an overview of previous charges in Vipps.

## 6. Manage agreements

If the user clicks on “Manage agreement” in the previous step, they will be sent to the merchant’s site where they can manage their subscriptions. We recommend using [Vipps Login](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-login-api) to make login to the merchant’s site go smoothly.
