## Problem types

The `type` is the primary identifier for a problem. It is an URL to a page with more details regarding the problem. 
Each problem type returned by the recurring api starts with `https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api/vipps-recurring-api-problems#` followed by a problem identifier. 

Example: `https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api/vipps-recurring-api-problems#invalid-agreement-id`
