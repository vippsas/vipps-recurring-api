      description: |-
        The API endpoint allows merchant to fetch all agreements.
        If no query status is supplied, it will default to only retrieving active agreements.
        There is no way to list all agreements with all statuses; this is due to performance.
        **Please note:** Use the query parameters `status` and `createdAfter` specify the
        agreements you want to retrieve, in order to speed up the query. Try to avoid
        requests without query parameters. Set `createdAfter` to the most recent value as possible.
        For instance, if you fetch ACTIVE agreements every 24 hours, use `createdAfter=now-25h` or similar.
        Not that, in the future, it may be possible to encounter errors when the number of agreements in the response is too high
        (e.g., `413 Content Too Large` or similar).

      description: |-
        The API endpoint allows merchants to create agreements for a user to accept. Once the agreement is drafted,you will receive a `vippsConfirmationUrl`.
        This is used to redirect the user to the landing page, or automatically app-switched to the app if `"isApp":true` is used.

        If the user accepts or rejects the agreement, the user will be redirected back to the URL specified in `merchantRedirectUrl`.
        You **have** to implement polling on the agreement to check when the status changes to active instead of relying on the redirect back to the `merchantRedirectUrl`.
        We have no control over if a user is actually redirected back or not, this depends on what browser the user came from.

        Please note the different use cases for `initialCharge` and `campaign`. And when to use `RESERVE_CAPTURE` instead of `DIRECT_CAPTURE` as `transactionType`.
        More information about this can be found in the API documentation.

        The API endpoint allows merchants to create agreements for a user to accept. Once the agreement is drafted, you will receive a `vippsConfirmationUrl`.
