        The API call allows merchants to create agreements for a user to accept. Once the agreement is drafted you will receive a `vippsConfirmationUrl`.
        This is used to redirect the user to the landing page, or to the app if `"isApp":true` is used.

        If the user accepts or rejects the agreement, the user will be redirected back to whichever URL has been passed in `merchantRedirectUrl`.
        You **have** to implement polling on the agreement to check when the status changes to active instead of relying on the redirect back to the `merchantRedirectUrl`.
        We have no control over if a user is actually redirected back or not, this depends on what browser the user came from.

        Please note the different use cases for `initialCharge` and `campaign`. And when to use `RESERVE_CAPTURE` instead of `DIRECT_CAPTURE` as transactionType.
