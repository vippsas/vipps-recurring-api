# Recurring API

<!-- START_COMMENT -->

ℹ️ Please use the website:
[Vipps MobilePay Technical Documentation](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/recurring-api).

<!-- END_COMMENT -->

The Recurring API allows you to set up recurring payments for your customers.
This allows your customers to pay subscriptions, donate, or make other recurring purchases without keying in card numbers or filling in long forms. In addition, your customers get a good overview of their fixed payments, and they get notification of withdrawals through Vipps.

Information about this product in Norwegian, see
[Faste betalinger med Vipps](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/faste-betalinger/faste-betalinger/).

**IMPORTANT:** The Vipps Recurring API is available for customers that
have "Vipps på Nett"
([eCom API](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs/ecom-api))
and have completed additional compliance checks.
See the intro to the
[API guide](vipps-recurring-api.md)
