# Vipps Recurring API

<!-- START_COMMENT -->

ℹ️ Please use the new documentation:

<!-- END_COMMENT -->

The Recurring API allows you to set up recurring payments for your customers.
This allows your customers to pay subscriptions, donate, or make other recurring purchases without keying in card numbers or filling in long forms. In addition, your customers get a good overview of their fixed payments and they get notification of withdrawals through Vipps.

Information about this product in Norwegian, see
[Faste betalinger med Vipps](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/faste-betalinger/faste-betalinger/).

**IMPORTANT:** The Vipps Recurring API is available for existing customers that
have "Vipps på Nett", a direct integration with the
[Vipps eCom API](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-developer-docs/docs/APIs/recurring-api),
and have completed some additional KYC checks required by Finanstilsynet.
Vipps is required to perform some extra compliance checks before
activating the Vipps Recurring API.
please order “Vipps Faste betalinger" on
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no)
to get access to the Recurring API in production.
