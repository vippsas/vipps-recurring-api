The Recurring API allows you to set up recurring payments for your customers.
This allows your customers to pay subscriptions, donate, or make other recurring purchases without keying in card numbers or filling in long forms. In addition, your customers get a good overview of their fixed payments, and they get notifications of withdrawals through Vipps MobilePay.

For information about this product in Norwegian, see
