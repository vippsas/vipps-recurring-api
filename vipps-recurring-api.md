# Vipps Recurring API

API version: 1.0

Document version 1.2.1.

The Vipps Recurring API delivers recurring payment functionality for a merchant
to create a payment agreement with a customer for fixed interval payments.
When the agreement is accepted by the end user the merchant can send charges
that will be automatically processed on the due date.

> **IMPORTANT:** The Vipps Recurring API is available for existing customers that
> have "Vipps på Nett" and a direct integration with the
> [Vipps eCom API](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-recurring-api)
> and have completed some additional KYC checks required by Finanstilsynet.
> Vipps is required to perform some extra compliance checks before
> activating the Vipps Recurring API, please
> [contact Vipps customer service](https://www.vipps.no/kontakt-oss/bedrift/vipps/)
> to get access to the Recurring API in production.

## How to perform recurring payments

![Recurring agreement flow](/images/Recurring-createagreement.svg)
Flowchart that shows how to create an agreement

1. Draft a new agreement to be approved with
[`POST:/agreements`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/draftAgreement).
The response contains an `agreementResource`, a `vippsConfirmationUrl` and an
`agreementId`. This `agreementResource` is a complete URL for performing a
[`GET:/agreements/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/getAgreement)
request. The `vippsConfirmationUrl` should be used to redirect the user to the
Vipps landing page on a Desktop flow, or Vipps app in a mobile flow,
where the user can then approve the agreement.

2. The approved agreement is retrieved from [`GET:/agreements/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/getAgreement) with `"status":"ACTIVE"` when the customer has approved the agreement.

3. Charge the customer for each period with [`POST:/agreements/{agreementId}/charges`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Charge%20Controller/createCharge).
Each specific charge on an agreement must be scheduled by the merchant, a
minimum of two days before the payment will occur (it is minimum one day in the test environment).
Example: If the charge is _created_ on the 25th, the earliest the charge can be
_made_ is the 27th (25+2).

**Note:** Vipps will *only* perform a payment transaction on an Agreement after
being told by the merchant through this endpoint. Vipps does not automatically
perform payments.

4. Manage charges and agreements with:  
* [`DELETE:/agreements/{agreementId}/charges/{chargeId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Charge%20Controller/cancelCharge)  
* [`POST:/agreements/{agreementId}/charges/{chargeId}/refund`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Charge%20Controller/refundCharge)  
* [`PATCH:/agreements/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/updateAgreement)

### Vipps screenshots

## Step 1: Draft an agreement

The following code illustrates how to create an agreement:

[`POST:/agreements`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/draftAgreement)

```json
{
  "currency": "NOK",
  "customerPhoneNumber":"90000000",
  "interval": "MONTH",
  "intervalCount": 1,
  "isApp": false,
  "merchantRedirectUrl": "https://example.com/confirmation",
  "merchantAgreementUrl": "https://example.com/my-customer-agreement",
  "price": 49900,
  "productDescription": "Access to all games of English top football",
  "productName": "Premier League subscription"
}
```

The `merchantAgreementUrl` is a link to a "My page", where the customer
can manage the agreement: Change, pause, cancel, etc.
Vipps does not offer any form of Agreement management, as this may be
quite complex operations, like changing subscription types,
temporary address change, etc.
The URL is opened in the standard web browser.

The `merchantAgreementUrl` is just a normal link to a page where the customer
can log in and manage the agreement. We strongly recommend to use
[Vipps Logg Inn](https://www.vipps.no/produkter-og-tjenester/bedrift/logg-inn-med-vipps/logg-inn-med-vipps/)
so the user does not have to use a username and password, but is logged
in automatically through Vipps. See the
[API documentation](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-login-api)
for more details.

The request parameters have the following size limits
(see
[`POST:/agreements`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/draftAgreement)
for more details):

* `productName`: Max length 45 characters
* `productDescription`: Max length 100 characters
* `price`: Greater than 100, meaning 1 NOK.

Agreements may be initiated with or without an [initial charge](#initial-charge),

The agreement price, and the amount for the initial charge, is given in øre,
the centesimal subdivision of the Norwegian kroner (NOK).
There are 100 øre in 1 krone.

| # | Agreement      | Description                                                                          |
|:--|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | `Agreement starting now`  | Agreement with an `initialcharge` that uses `DIRECT_CAPTURE` will only be `active` if the initial charge is processed successfully |
| 2 | `Agreement starting in future`  | Agreement without an `initialcharge`, or with `initialcharge` that uses `RESERVE_CAPTURE` can be approved but no payment will happen until the first charge is provided |

### Accepting the agreement

[`POST:/agreements`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/draftAgreement) will return the following JSON structure.

```json
{
  "vippsConfirmationUrl": "https://api.vipps.no/dwo-api-application/v1/deeplink/vippsgateway?v=2/token=eyJraWQiOiJqd3RrZXkiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJmMDE0MmIxYy02YjI",
  "agreementResource": "https://api.vipps.no-recurring/v2/agreements/agr_TGSuPyV",
  "agreementId": "agr_TGSuPyV"
}
```

The `vippsConfirmationUrl` should be used to redirect the user to the Vipps landing
page. The user can then confirm their identity, and receive a prompt to accept the
agreement within the Vipps app.

The `isApp` property can be used to receive a deeplink URL, which in a mobile context,
can be used to perform an app-switch, which removes the landing page step. This will only
work if the user has Vipps installed on the same device as they are initiating
the agreement from.

### Intervals

Intervals are defined with a interval type `MONTH`, `WEEK`, or `DAY` and frequency as a count.

Example for a bi-weekly subscription:
```json
"interval": "WEEK",
"intervalCount": 2,
```

Example for a quarterly subscription
```json
"interval": "MONTH",
"intervalCount": 3,
```

Example for a yearly subscription
```json
"interval": "MONTH",
"intervalCount": 12,
```

Example for a subscription every 100th day:
```json
"interval": "DAY",
"intervalCount": 100,
```

### Initial charge

Initial charge will be performed if the `initialcharge` is provided when
creating an agreement. Unlike regular (or `RECURRING`) charges, there is no
price limit on an `initialCharge`. This allows for products to be bundled with
agreements as one transaction (for example a phone). The user will be clearly
informed when an `initialCharge` is included in the agreement they are accepting.

See [Charge Titles](#charge-title) for explanation of how the charge description
is shown to the user.

The initial charge has two forms of transaction, `DIRECT_CAPTURE` and `RESERVE_CAPTURE`.  

`DIRECT_CAPTURE` processes the payment immediately, while `RESERVE_CAPTURE`
reserves the payment for capturing at a later date, this must be used when
selling physical goods bundled with an agreement. Such as a phone, when
subscribing to an agreement for example.

This example shows the same agreement as above, with an `initialCharge`
of 499 NOK:

```
{
  "currency": "NOK",
  "customerPhoneNumber":"90000000",
  "initialCharge": {
     "amount": 49900,
     "currency": "NOK",
     "description": "Premier League subscription",
     "transactionType": "DIRECT_CAPTURE"
  "interval": "MONTH",
  "intervalCount": 1,
  "isApp": false,
  "merchantRedirectUrl": "https://example.com/confirmation",
  "merchantAgreementUrl": "https://example.com/my-customer-agreement",
  "price": 49900,
  "productDescription": "Access to all games of English top football",
  "productName": "Premier League subscription"
}
```   

Change the `transactionType` field to `RESERVE_CAPTURE` to reserve the initial charge.

```json
"initialCharge": {
  "transactionType": "RESERVE_CAPTURE",
  "amount": 19900,
  "currency": "NOK",
  "description": "Phone"
},
```
A reserved charge can be captured with
[`POST:/agreements/{agreementId}/charges/{chargeId}/capture`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Charge%20Controller/captureCharge)
when the product is shipped.

### Campaigns
A campaign in recurring is a period where the price is lower than usual, and
this is communicated to the customer with the original price shown for comparison.

![Campaign example](images/CampaignExample.PNG)

In order to start a campaign the campaign field has to be added either to the agreement draft
[`POST:/agreements`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/draftAgreement)
for a campaign in the start of an agreement or update an agreement
[`PATCH:/agreements/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/updateAgreement)
for an ongoing agreement. When adding a campaign
while drafting a new agreement the start date is ignored and the current
date-time is used. All dates must be in date-time format as according to
[RFC-3999](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt).

```json
"campaign": {
  "start": "2019-05-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end": "2019-06-01T00:00:00Z",
  "campaignPrice": 49900
}
```

| Field         | Description                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `start`            | Start date of campaign offer, if you are creating a agreement this is set to default now, and not an available variable  |
| `end`            | End date of campaign offer, can not be in the past |
| `campaignPrice`       | The price that will be shown for comparison   |


## Step 2: Retrieve the approved agreement

The agreement will be in status `PENDING` for 5 minutes before it expires.
If the customer approves the agreement, and the initialCharge (if provided) is successfully
processed, the agreement status will change to `active`.

[`GET:/agreements/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/getAgreement)
```json
{
  "id": "agr_5kSeqzFAMkfBbc",
  "start": "2018-08-22T13:00:00Z",
  "stop": null,
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "productName": "Premier League subscription",
  "price": 49900,
  "productDescription": "Access to all games of English top football",
  "interval": "MONTH",
  "intervalCount": 1,
  "currency": "NOK",
  "campaign": null,
}
```
### Pausing an agreement

If there should be a pause in an agreement, like a temporary stop of a
subscription: Simply do not create any charges during the pause.

## Step 3: Create a charge

Create a charge for a given agreement. `due` will define for which date
the charge will be performed. This date has to be at a minimum two days in the
future (it is minimum one day in the test environment), and all charges `due` in
30 days or less are visible for users in the
Vipps app. The `amount` of a charge is flexible and does not have to match the
`price` of the agreement.

A limit is in place however, which is 10 times the agreement `price` during the
span of the last `interval`. For example, in the agreement
[above](#step-2-retrieve-the-approved-agreement) a limit of 4990 NOK (499 x 10)
over the last single `MONTH` period would be in place. If this limit becomes a
hindrance the agreement `price` can be [updated](#updating-an-agreement).

An optional `orderId` field can be set in the request, if used this will be the
id used to identify the charge throughout its payment history, including in
settlement files. This `orderId` must be unique across all Recurring and eCom
transactions for the given `merchantSerialNumber`. If the field is not given a
unique id will be generated in the form `chr_xxxxxxx` (where x is a alphanumeric
character). In settlements this auto generated Id is presented as `chrULxxxxxxx`.

### Charge descriptions

When charges are shown to users in the Vipps app, they will have a title, and a description. The title of a charge is derived directly from `{agreement.ProductName}` whereas the description is set per charge, ie. `{charge.description}`. For example, a charge on an agreement with product name *Premier League subscription* with description *October* would look like the following screen shot:

![Charge description example](images/charge_descriptions_example.png)

When the charge is processed, the payment will show up in the users's payment history. In the payment history a charge from Vipps recurring payment will have a description with follow format `{agreement.ProductName} - {charge.description}`.


[`POST:/agreements/{agreementId}/charges`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Charge%20Controller/createCharge)
```json
{
  "amount": 49900,
  "currency": "NOK",
  "description": "October",
  "due": "2018-09-01",
  "retryDays": 5
}
```

**Note** `description` cannot be longer than 45 characters.

### Charge times

Charge _attempts_ are made two times during the day: 08:00 og 16:00 UTC.
Subsequent attempts are made according to the `retryDays` specified.

### Charge retries

Vipps will retry the charge for the number of days specified in `retryDays`.
If `retryDays=0` it will be failed after the first attempt.

## Step 4: Manage charges and agreements

* Cancel charges with [`DELETE:/agreements/{agreementId}/charges/{chargeId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Charge%20Controller/cancelCharge).
* Refund performed charges with [`POST:/agreements/{agreementId}/charges/{chargeId}/refund`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Charge%20Controller/refundCharge).
* Update agreements with [`PATCH:/agreements/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/updateAgreement) in case there are any changes. See [Updating an Agreement](#updating-an-agreement)

### Agreement states

| # | State      | Description                                                                          |
|:--|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | `PENDING`  | Agreement has been created, but not approved by the user in the app yet |
| 2 | `ACTIVE` | The Agreement has been confirmed by the end user in the app and can receive charges |
| 3 | `STOPPED`  | Agreement has been stopped by the merchant most, typically when the end user wants to cancel the payment agreement |
| 4 | `EXPIRED` | The user did not accept, or failed to accept (due to processing an `initialCharge`), the agreement within the app |

### Charge states

![Recurring charge states](images/Recurring-chargestates-new.svg)

| # | State      | Description                                                                          |
|:--|:-----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | `PENDING`  | Charge has been created. |
| 2 | `DUE` | The charge will be made in the next 30 days (this was previously 6), and can now be viewed by the user in the app |
| 3 | `CHARGED`  | Charge has been completed |
| 4 | `FAILED`  | Charge has failed for some reason, i.e. Expired card, insufficient funds, etc. |
| 5 | `REFUNDED` | Charge successfully refunded. Timeframe for issuing a refund for a payment is 365 days from the date payment has been captured |
| 6 | `PARTIALLY_REFUNDED`| Charge successfully refunded, used if the refund is a partial amount of the captured amount. |
| 7 | `RESERVED` | Initial charge with `transactionType` set to `RESERVE_CAPTURE`, changes state to `CHARGED` when captured successfully. |


### Updating an Agreement

A merchant can update an agreement by calling
[`PATCH:/agreements/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/updateAgreement).
The following properties are available for updating:

```json
{
  "productName": "A new name",
  "productDescription": "A new description",
  "price": 25000,
  "status": "ACTIVE",
  "campaign": {
    "start": "2019-10-01T00:00:00Z",
    "end": "2019-12-01T00:00:00Z",
    "campaignPrice": 10000
  }
}
```

As a `PATCH` operation all parameters are optional. However when setting an
agreement status to `STOPPED` no other changes are allowed. Attempts at changing
other properties while stopping an agreement will result in a
`400 Bad Request` response.

## Agreement life cycle recommendations

As seen in the section [Updating an Agreement](#Updating-an-Agreement), merchants
can update agreements through our API. It is always the merchant's responsibility
to manage and update agreements, since users are unable to make changes to their
agreements directly in the Vipps app. Users will most likely request changes to
their subscriptions through the merchant's channels. Here are some typical change
scenarios, and corresponding recommendations:

### Stopping a recurring payment

When a user notifies the merchant that they want to cancel a subscription or
service, the merchant must ensure that the status of the recurring agreement is
set to `STOPPED` at a suitable time.

We recommend that the recurring agreement remains `ACTIVE` for as long as the
user has access to the service. For example, if the user cancels their
subscription but they are still able to use the service until the end of the
billing cycle, the agreement should only be set to `STOPPED` at the end of the
billing cycle.  In this case we also recommend updating the `productDescription`
field of the agreement so that the user can see that the subscription is
cancelled or due to be cancelled at a given time.

Since `STOPPED` agreements cannot be reactivated, a benefit of waiting until
the "end of service" before setting the agreement status to `STOPPED` is that
the merchant will be able to reactivate the user's subscription without having
to set up a new agreement.

### Pausing a recurring payment

It's recommended not to *stop* the agreement, but rather stop sending charges
until the user wishes to resume the subscription. It's also recommended to update
the `productDescription` field of the agreement so the user can see that the
subscription is paused in the Vipps app.

## Userinfo

**Important:** This is an early draft, this should be considered pilot
functionality that we are currently rolling out in our test environemnt.
Swagger will be fully updated
shortly

Vipps offers a functionality to ask for a generic consent to access Userinfo.
This is based on the
[Vipps Login](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-login-api)
solution, but merchants can seamlessly combine the two functionalites
in a single user session. Combining both the userinfo and payment elements
requires the merchant to be registered with both Vipps Login and
Vipps Recurring APIs.

When you initiate a payment add the parameter `scope` to ask for a user's
consent to share these details, such as email, address and name.
The scopes are based 

| Scopes      | Description                                    | User consent required  |
| ------------| -----------------------------------------------|-------- |
| address     | List containing the users addresses. Will always contain home, but can also include work and other.    |   yes   |
| birthDate   | User birth date (BankID verified)                               |   yes   |
| email       | User email (verified), the flag "email_verified : true" in the response can be used by merchant to confirm for each request that the email actually is verified                                   |   yes   |
| name        | User first, middle and given name (verified with National Population Register)              |   yes   |
| phoneNumber | Verified phone number (verfied - the number used with Vipps)                          |   yes   |
| nin        | Norwegian national identity number (verified with BankID). NB: merchants need to apply for access to NIN. Go to [Who can get access to NIN and how?](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-login-api/blob/master/vipps-login-api-faq.md#who-can-get-access-to-nin-and-how) For more information |   yes      |
| accountNumbers | User bank account numbers. NB: merchants need to apply for access to accountNumbers. Go to [Who can get access to account numbers and how?](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-login-api/blob/master/vipps-login-api-faq.md#who-can-get-access-to-accountnumbers-and-how) For more information |   yes      |


To request these scopes add the scopes to the initial call to
[`POST:​/v2​/agreements`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/draftAgreement)

The user then consents and pays in the app.

**Please note:** This operation has an all or nothing approach, a user must
complete a valid Agreement and consent to all values in order to complete the
session. If a user chooses to reject the terms the payment will not be
processed. Unless the whole flow is completed, this will be handled as regular
a failed Agreement by the recurring APIs

Once the user completes the session a unique identifier `sub` can be retrieved in the agreement details
[`GET:/v2/agreements/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/getAgreement) endpoint. 

Example `sub` format:

```
"sub": "c06c4afe-d9e1-4c5d-939a-177d752a0944",
```

This `sub` is a link between the merchant and the user and can used to retrieve
the user's details from Vipps Login:
[`GET:/userinfo/{sub}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-login-api/#/Vipps%20Log%20In%20API/userinfo)
You also get the `userinfoUrl` value which can be used as a direct url to retrive the userdata. in the agreement details
[`GET:/v2/agreements/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/Agreement%20Controller/getAgreement) 
that you can use directly.

**Please note:** accessing the Login `userinfo` endpoint requires the
Vipps Login access token:
[`POST:/oauth2/token`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-login-api/#/Vipps%20Log%20In%20API/oauth2Token).

![Userinfo sequence](images/userinfo-direct.png)

## HTTP responses

This API returns the following HTTP statuses in the responses:

| HTTP status                 | Description                                 |

| `422 Unprocessable Entity`  | Vipps could not process                     |
| `429 Too Many Requests`     | Look at [table below to view current rate limits](#rate-limiting)   |
| `500 Server Error`          | An internal Vipps problem.                  |

All error responses contains an `error` object in the body, with details of the
problem.

## Rate limiting

We have added rate limit to our apis (http:429) to prevent fradulent and wrongful behaviour and increase stability and security of our APIs. These shouldn't affect normal behaviour at all, but feel free to contact us if you notice any weird behaviour.

## Authentication and authorization - API access token

For all product request we require the use of a `Authorization` header.
This header is required by making a Access Token request with the values
`client_id`, `client_secret` and `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`.

See [Get an access token](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md#get-an-access-token)
in the
[Getting started guide](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-developers/blob/master/vipps-getting-started.md)
for more information.
